# Purpose of the Document

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines in detail the functional and non-functional requirements for the **Password Policy** feature to be developed on the Serive Portal Cloudeka. Its objectives are:

- **Clarity & Alignment:** Provide a single source of truth for all stakeholders (product owners, developers, QA, support, and operations) so that everyone understands exactly what the Password Policy must do and how it must behave.
- **Scope Definition:** Clearly delineate what is in-scope (e.g., 90-day expiration, 7-day reminder emails, confirmation emails) and what is out-of-scope for this release.
- **Basis for Design & Implementation:** Serve as the foundation for system architects and developers to design the solution, select appropriate technologies (e.g. cron jobs, SMTP server), and implement according to industry best practices.
- **Test Planning:** Guide QA engineers in writing test cases and acceptance criteria, ensuring that every requirement can be verified.
- **Maintenance & Future Enhancements:** Act as documentation for future maintenance, bug fixes, and potential feature expansions (e.g. customizable expiration period, multi-factor reminders).
